**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">DESCRIPTION OF THE VENTURE</span>**

The Name of our company is Gagarian. It is a partnership company. We sell Injera baked by ‘Gagarians’ means union of bakers, locally and at export level. Injera is the most common food eaten by Ethiopians and most women in Ethiopia can bake Injera. Our company will find women who are currently working at different households as bakers and those who sell tea and coffee in the street and provide this working opportunity for them. The gagrians will be provided a better payment and working condition by our company. 

For starter, the company will have one Injera selling store locally and 

e-commerce site for people to order Injera online. We will also have contact with stores found outside Ethiopia for instance in U.S.A and Dubai.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mission</span>**

The purpose of our company is to provide quality Injera with fair price. As for the gagarians we will help them franchise our store and with our company.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Objective</span>**

The objective of our company is creating a better working condition for women gagarians and deliver quality Injera for Injera loving community.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Market Analysis</span>**

Injera is the most eaten food in Ethiopia. So, there is no wonder that there is high demand in our country and wherever there is a person raised in Ethiopia. Using this advantage, we believe it is a very profitable sector if quality Injera is delivered. When we start we plan on launching one store in Ethiopia and have contract with different hotels and Injera selling stores both inside and outside Ethiopia. In the future we have a plan to launch more stores in Ethiopia and also own store in foreign countries where people who love Injera lives.


# COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

The advantage of our competitors is that they are already in the market and have a lot of customers including foreign stores. The other advantage is that they have a lot of sensitive information about the business. Despite all this especially in the local market there is still a lot of complain on the quality of injera. Shortage is another problem faced. This means the market need more quality Injera selling companies. 

In addition to that our company provides a platform that will let customers buy different Injera Packages. Some of the packages we have are Event packages, Family packages and so much more. This can be seen in detail from the website we developed. This system is completely new for our country. These are some of the advantages we have over our competitors.


# Resource Requirement 

The resources we need to make Injera are the following:



* Teff (white or red)
* Water

Other required resources are:



* Injera Mesob
* Bali
* Megageria Jog
* Sefed
* Gomen zer
* Enkeb
* Bermel

The other main resource we need is human resource. Firstly we need gagarians then according the different type of department we have in our company we need Administrator, Financial manager, Tech Manager, Marketing Manager and human resource manager.  Since we take other 

additional courses than our field(computer filed) like business management we are currently working on this department with the help of professionals.


# QUALITY ASSURANCE

Providing a quality product is something we don’t negotiate. Quality starts with the kind of Teff we use to bake Injera. In spite of the high cost we plan to get Teff from known teff providers in our country. Though baking Injera is something very common for a Ethiopian women to do, we make sure the gagarians are well experience. To assure the quality of our service we planned on hiring with a higher salary.

**Executive Summary**

In Ethiopia, there are a lot of women who lead their lives baking Injera for hotels and households with little payment and there are women who sell tea and coffee in the street. Our company will hire these women with better payment and working condition. Since Injera is the most eaten food and qulaity becomes the main concern, if a company sell Injera with quality it is no question that there is demand in the market. 

When we start the business we will hire 20 gagarians. The gagarians will work 8 hours a day and get 7,800ETB per month. All working materials and other resources will be provided by the company. From the daily income statement we can see that the company will have 66,800ETB per day. Assuming this will continue for 26 working days of the month we will earn 1,128,920ETB per month assuming selling 1000 Injera locally and 1400 Injera to U.S.A. for 26 days in the month. If this smoothly continues for 6 months will earn 6,773,520ETB which give us the capacity to double number of gagarians. Since this is one of the main objectives we have in the company this will be a big success.

In the future we plan on exporting more products like bread, Ethiopian snacks( KOLO, DABOKOLO,…), Spices and so on. Which are just some of the things Ethiopian women can do. With this we believe we(owners of the company and gagarians) will be more and more profitable by providing products right from the hands the Ethiopian mothers.
